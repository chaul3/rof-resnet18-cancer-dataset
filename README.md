## Methodology

This project investigates the relevance of individual penultimate-layer features in a ResNet-18 model trained for skin lesion classification (ISIC dataset). The methodology is inspired by the approach described in Role Taxonomy of Units in Deep Neural Networks by Yang Zhao, Hao Zhang, and Xiuyuan Hu (Tsinghua University).

### 1. Baseline Model Evaluation

- The pretrained ResNet-18 model is loaded and evaluated on the test set to establish baseline accuracy metrics.
- The evaluation uses standard classification metrics, including mean accuracy and group-wise accuracies.

### 2. Feature Extraction

- Penultimate-layer (second-to-last layer) features are extracted for all test samples.
- This is done by forwarding each sample through the network up to the average pooling layer, resulting in a feature vector for each image.

### 3. Feature Ranking

- The importance of each penultimate-layer unit is estimated by computing the mean L1-norm (absolute activation) across the test set.
- Units are ranked in descending order of their mean L1-norm, under the hypothesis that higher-activation units are more relevant for classification.

### 4. Relevance of Features (ROF) Analysis

- To assess the contribution of top-ranked units, a masking strategy is applied:
    - For each value of *k* (from 1 up to the total number of units), only the top-*k* units (by L1-norm ranking) are "activated" (retained); all others are set to zero.
    - The modelâ€™s forward pass is patched to use these masked features for classification.
- The model is evaluated for each *k*, and accuracy metrics are recorded, resulting in accuracy-vs-units curves.

### 5. Visualization

- The accuracy curves for different metrics (mean accuracy, group accuracies, etc.) are plotted as a function of the number of activated units.
- The baseline accuracy is shown as a reference.
- These plots illustrate how model performance depends on the number and identity of penultimate-layer features, providing insight into feature relevance and redundancy.
